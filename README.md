# YAWL (Yet Another Whitelist Plugin)

**YAWL** is an incredibly simple, lightweight, and efficient whitelist plugin designed exclusively for the **Velocity** proxy. If you need a no-fuss, easy-to-manage whitelist solution that just works, this is the plugin for you.

## üöÄ Overview

The core philosophy of YAWL is **simplicity**. In a world of complex plugins, YAWL stands out by doing one thing and doing it well. It manages a server whitelist through a plain text file (`whitelist.txt`), making it easy to view, edit, and manage without needing databases or complicated commands. It's built to be as performant and unobtrusive as possible, ensuring zero impact on your server's performance.

## ‚ú® Why Choose YAWL?

  * **‚ö° Lightweight:** The plugin has a minimal footprint. It's written to be extremely efficient and won't add any bloat or lag to your proxy.
  * **‚úèÔ∏è Simple Text-Based Management:** All whitelisted players are stored in a simple `whitelist.txt` file. You can edit this file directly and reload the plugin in-game.
  * **‚öôÔ∏è Straightforward Configuration:** A clean `config.toml` file allows you to toggle the whitelist, change message languages, and set case sensitivity with ease.
  * **üåç Multi-Language Support:** YAWL comes with multiple pre-packaged languages (`en`, `ar`, `de`, `es`, `fr`, `ja`, `ru`, `uk`, `zh-cn`, `pt-br`, `tr`). It can even **automatically display messages in a player's client language**\!
  * **üîÑ Live Reload:** No need to restart your entire proxy. A simple command reloads the configuration and the whitelist instantly.
  * **üîí Permissions-Ready:** Fine-grained permission nodes give you complete control over who can manage the whitelist.

## üì¶ Installation

1.  Download the latest version of the plugin from the [Releases](https://github.com/renwixx/YetAnotherWhitelistPlugin/releases) page or Modrinth (currently unavialable).
2.  Place the downloaded `.jar` file into the `plugins` folder of your Velocity proxy.
3.  Start or restart your proxy.
4.  The default configuration (`config.toml`), locales, and an empty `whitelist.txt` file will be generated in `plugins/yawl`. Edit them to your liking\!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The configuration is handled in the `plugins/yawl/config.toml` file.

```toml
[settings]
# Enable or disable the whitelist. If false, the plugin will not kick anyone.
enabled = true

# Sets the language for plugin messages.
# Corresponds to a file name in the 'locales' folder (e.g., "en", "ru").
locale = "en"

# If true and the client has a language set that exists in the plugin's locales folder, it will be displayed.
# If false, it will display default locale defined by upper setting.
use-client-locale = false

# If true, player names in the whitelist will be case-sensitive (e.g., "Player" is different from "player").
# If false, case will be ignored ("Player" and "player" are the same).
# It's recommended to keep this 'false' for user-friendliness.
case-sensitive = false

# Kick active player immediately after whitelist removal or expiry.
# If false, the player will remain connected until they reconnect or reload occurs.
kick-active-on-revoke = true
```
